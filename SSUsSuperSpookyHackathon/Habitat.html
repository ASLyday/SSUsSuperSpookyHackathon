    <div class = "opacity"><p>The Cotton Candy Lobster is almost mythic when it comes to rarity. This is due to it actually being a mutation to its blackish-brown counterparts. This
        spooky fella was found off of the coast of Main, meaning that it's likely an American Lobster. American Lobsters commonly live in the coast of the North Atlantic, specifically 
        they are <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/american-lobster">abundantly found from Main through New Jersey</a> where they love to dine on 
        a variety of other aquatic life. So always beware the home of the Cotton Candy Lobster!
